J.P. leaves home to enter their community on December 30th, 2023. We have created this webpage to let you know a bit about what life as a Carmelite Hermit will be like and how you can support his religious vocation.

You are probably familiar with holy Carmelites nuns, such as St. Teresa of Ávila or St. Thérèse of Lisieux. Yet, the origin of the order can be traced to Mount Carmel in northwestern Israel, where a number of devout men, apparently former pilgrims and Crusaders, established themselves around 1155 A.D. They followed the example of the holy prophet St. Elias who lived as a solitary contemplative (3 Kings 17:1).

The Discalced Hermits of Our Lady of Mount Carmel are zealous for the glory of God, the spiritual renewal of the Church, and the sanctification of souls. These men are reviving the charism and religious observance of the ancient Carmelite Fathers and consecrate themselves to a contemplative life of prayer and sacrifice. Striving to emulate their saintly predecessors, the Hermits labor night and day in mental prayer, sacred liturgy, spiritual study, fraternal charity, silence, solitude, fasting and penance.

As specifically discalced or “barefooted” religious, the Hermits observe a unique poverty and austerity that is not common in the secular world or even in most religious communities today. The Hermits forego the regular use of modern conveniences like electricity, running water, and modern heating or cooling. They cultivate a greater simplicity by a more rustic and virile lifestyle, in opposition to a modern world that is estranged from the interior life and enslaved by physical comfort.

Upon entering, J.P. will receive his habit and begin a 6–12-month Postulancy. This is followed by a 1–2-year Novitiate, when he will be tonsured and receive a new religious name. God-willing he perseveres, there is a 3–6-year Temporary Profession that takes place before the final step of Solemn Profession. Although these ceremonies are not open to the public, the Hermits never have the same physical separation of a grille, as in the case of cloistered nuns.

We can rejoice that J.P. has been blessed with such an excellent state of life and noble spiritual mission for the service of God and the Church. In order to foster and protect his spiritual life and religious formation, he must forgo the noise and distraction of all digital exchanges. As immediate family members, we may exchange letters with J.P. and include brief messages about our relatives and friends. After he has completed Postulancy, his immediate and extended family may visit for up to four days per year. The Hermits do not leave the monastery to attend family gatherings, such as weddings or funerals.

If you would like to support J.P., prayers are always necessary. We have also set up a wishlist filled with items that he will need upon entering. Of course, the Hermits rely on alms for their food and are always in need of regular donations. Since the monastery was established in 2019, they have seen exponential growth. To accommodate the additional 20 men entering this year, the Hermits are building their next monastery foundation in southern Colorado. More information can be found [online](https://edcarm.org/foundations/).

#### Thank you for sharing in our excitement and joy as J.P. prepares for entrance to the religious life. As the Carmelites say, “May God reward you!”
